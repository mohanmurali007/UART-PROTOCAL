# UART-protocol
 Developed a UART communication system between a PC and Basys 3 FPGA board using Verilog, enabling serial data
 transmission and reception through PuTTY terminal.
 Designed and integrated multiple Verilog modules including UART_test (top level module), UART_top, receiver, transmitter, debouncer, FIFO, 
 and a baud rate generator for robust and modular hardware architecture.
 Tools used: Vivado, PuTTY
